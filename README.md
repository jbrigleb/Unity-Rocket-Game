This Game was made following instruction in the Complete C# Unity Developer 3D course taught by Ben Tristem.

### What I've learned:

Using SerializeField to expose data members in the inspector, as opposed to making them public.

There is a popular gitignore file I utilized to maintain a much cleaner repository

How to use Sourcetree to maintain a local repo (as opposed to command line), and then publish to github later.

Many different small functionalities of the editor, such as viewing private data members of scripts in the inspectorâ€™s debug mode, holding shift to navigate faster in the fly mode, etc.

How applying changes to a prefab from and instance of that prefab works, and how other instances will and won't be affected. 

### What I've reinforced:

Using a switch to determine state.

Simplifying functions by breaking them down into smaller functions can be useful for readability, even if the subfunctions may not be used elsewhere.

Developing in 3D is a lot more fun and tangible than developing in 2D, for me.
